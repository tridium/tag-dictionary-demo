This is an example module that implements a custom tag, relation, and condition. It also includes examples of tag dictionary configuration JSON files.

You will need to set up your certificate in order to compile and run this code, and configure the `niagaraSigning` task in the `build.gradle.kts` file.
See the developer documentation for information on how to set up your signing certificate.

You will also need to change the gradle.properties contents to point to your Niagara installation.
